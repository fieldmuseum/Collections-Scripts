## A script to pull basic summary statistics for EMu Multimedia

Run this from command line by entering `Rscript mmStats.R`

This script reads in an export from EMu estatistics that summarizes
monthly numbers of new/updated/deleted records in each module.

From that, the script pulls numbers for Multimedia records, and 
outputs a chart and HTML for the [Multimedia GUID redirector site](https://mm.fieldmuseum.org)
