# EMu Data Handling Scripts

These scripts are meant to help users handle, reshape, and/or filter collections data from the EMu collections management system.

## 'Pub MM' check
This script filters a set of irn's for only those whose first attached Multimedia is restricted (not published online).


## 'Table Spread' script 

This script reshapes data with multiple values per record from "long" to "wide"

For EMu-users, this is useful if you report data out of table fields, and need to re-import it to those table fields.
