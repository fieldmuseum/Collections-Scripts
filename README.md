# Collections Scripts #

This is a repository of some basic scripts for handling/mangling data, and possibly a few other occasional uses [e.g., semi-functional templates for web-scraping].


### Data-Handling Scripts ###

For common steps in EMu-data-handling workflows that are cumbersome in Excel/Access/OpenRefine, try out these R scripts...


### Web-Scraping Template-Scripts ###

For salvaging web-content, try out these maybe-not-so-general-purpose Python scripts...


### Bokeh & Shiny Scripts ###

For interactively visualizing some datasets...


### General R Suggestions ###
To keep code clean & manageable:
- Follow a styleguide -- e.g.,  [tidyverse's](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- Set up unit tests -- e.g., with [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)
- Document your stuff -- e.g., with [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)
